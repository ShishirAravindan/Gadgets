			Everyone knows how hard it is to get rid of habits, but with the plastic box timer you can get
			rid of any habit or addicton related to food, gaming and the list goes on.
		
			It has a simple mechanism, you put in something related to your habit into the box(for example,
			a PS4 controller, if you have an addiction related to gaming) and you input a number in the timer.
			This way you won't be able to use whatever is inside(in our case, the PS4 controller) because the box
			won't open until the timer is finished.<br>
